# Game Scenes Plugin

This plugin adds interactive game visualizations to your LED Matrix.

## Included Scenes

### Ping Pong Game
A classic Pong-style game visualization with AI players.

The game simulates two paddles bouncing a ball back and forth across the display.

### Tetris
An automated Tetris game with AI playing.

The plugin includes a neural network that makes decisions about piece placement, rotation, and movement. The AI tries to maximize score by completing lines while building efficiently.

### Maze Game
A maze generation and solving visualization.

This scene generates random mazes using the Hunt-and-Kill algorithm and then solves them using the A* pathfinding algorithm. The scene shows both the maze generation process and the solution path.
